DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK : 📚 Library RESTful API using Flask

The Library RESTful API is a lightweight web application developed using the Flask framework in Python. It demonstrates the design and implementation of a simple yet functional API that performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a collection of books. This project serves as an introduction to RESTful architecture, API endpoints, and backend development concepts.

The application provides multiple routes for interacting with book data stored in memory. Users can retrieve the list of available books, view a specific book by its ID, add new books, update existing book details, or delete a book from the collection. Each operation follows RESTful principles and communicates through HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. JSON is used as the data format for both requests and responses, ensuring interoperability and ease of testing.

The API is built with simplicity and clarity in mind. The code in app.py defines all necessary routes, handles different types of requests, and returns structured responses. The requirements.txt file includes the Flask dependency, allowing users to quickly set up the environment using pip install -r requirements.txt. The README.md provides setup instructions and usage examples for running the API locally.

This project helps students and beginners understand the fundamentals of backend development, web services, and how Flask can be used to build APIs for real-world applications. It can be easily extended by integrating a database like SQLite or MongoDB, adding authentication, or connecting it with a frontend interface. Overall, the Library RESTful API is a practical and educational example of how Python and Flask can be used to develop efficient and scalable web applications.
